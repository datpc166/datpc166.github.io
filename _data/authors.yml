   bio: "Hi! My name is Amy, and Im a programmer based in the UK! I love playing and making video games and recently entering the games industry has only increased my interest in games development. Im a big fan of technical and creative experimentation, and I do this by participating in gamejams and small projects  in my spare time. I love learning new things, from game engines and programming all the way to maths and fun projects using an Arduino."
