Until now, there is no exact information or specific time to determine how and when the Lunar New Year originated.However, some information suggests that the Lunar New Year originated in China and was imported to Vietnam during the 1000 years of Northern domination. But according to the story of "Banh chung and Banh day", Vietnamese people have been celebrating Tet since the Hung Kings, that is, before 1000 years of Northern domination, so this is still a controversial issue.

When it comes to Tet, it is impossible not to mention Chung cake. It is like a flavor of Tet, without it, it cannot be called Tet. Many people's childhood was spent sitting around a pot of banh chung with their families and telling stories and gossiping together, but now it is difficult to find activities like in the past. Those banh chung will be offered to ancestors or given to relatives, making the taste of Tet even stronger.
