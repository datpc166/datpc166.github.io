<p>I’ve always been interested to help out students with learning more about games development.<br />At this point, I had <em>never</em> done any games mentoring beforehand, and the mentoring knowledge I had, in general, was very small as I’m still a student at the moment. I usually find that the best way to learn what you want is to <em>just do</em> whatever it is you want to learn, and <strong>dive into the deep end</strong>, and so once I heard about this mentoring opportunity, I applied <strong>straight away!</strong></p>
<p>In comparison to the <a href="/blog/helping-students-with-a-gamejam/" style="padding: 0px" target="_blank"> SideFest mentoring role</a> I have done a week or two after this, this role was more involved, and so this opportunity by Into Games was perfect! I was tasked with helping several college students from Access Creative College through <strong>designing</strong> and <strong>prototyping</strong> a game <strong>as a team</strong>, and this would involve me running <strong>daily stand-ups</strong> and <strong>sessions on project management</strong>.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:center; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px">How to prepare a PowerPoint for teaching</h3>
<p>In my <a href="/blog/helping-students-with-a-gamejam/" style="padding: 0px" target="_blank"> SideFest mentoring blog</a>, I made a PowerPoint for teaching the students about how to publish their game onto Itch.io and I wasn’t the one presenting those, but these PowerPoints I’m using <strong>during my sessions</strong> which I run with the students.</p>

<p>I had to make sure the sessions I organized went along with the <strong>objectives</strong> given on the internal objectives document, so following along with that, I made this PowerPoint so it had all the objectives, and some other key points within it, which I would further be able to talk about during the sessions.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:center; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px">Presenting to and preparing a group</h3>
<p>As mentioned before, this opportunity to help students was different from my other mentoring experience as this was a lot more hands-on, and due to this, my role was to <strong>run daily stand-ups</strong> for my team and run some <strong>other sessions</strong> as well to help them <strong>understand</strong> what they had to do.</p>
<p>The sessions which I had to help the students out on were scheduled for a certain amount of time, with the introduction and daily stand-ups being 15 minutes, and the other sessions being a bit longer, so having a scheduled amount of time helped me keep an eye on how long my sessions ran and make sure the content fits within the time.</p>
<p>Preparing a group to make a game, or a project is something I’ve briefly done in the past when making game jam games or university projects, but it has never been the main focus like this would be.<br />So, using what I’ve learned before, for the first session, <strong>I got to know each of the students</strong>, informed them of the <strong>plans for the week</strong>, told them about the sites which they’re going to be using, <strong>briefed the project</strong> to them, and helped them with getting prepared to approach the project, by <strong>helping them assign roles</strong> to each other, and this went well!</p>
<p>The next session I had with the students was to <strong>see their ideas</strong> and <strong>help</strong> them pick their favorite <em>without influencing their final choice</em> too much, so, I asked them <strong>questions</strong> about each idea (which is on the PowerPoint!) – Which would help them decide as a group which of their ideas is the strongest.</p>
<p>I won’t explain every session which I had with the students, but through daily stand-ups with them, I was able to help them out with any <strong>feedback</strong>, or <strong>general help</strong> they needed, and I was able to track their progress by asking them <strong>what they achieved yesterday</strong>, and <strong>what they plan on doing that day</strong>.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:center; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Through helping these students out for game development work experience, I was able to learn more about <strong>teaching</strong>, <strong>giving feedback</strong>, and most of all, <strong>project management</strong>.</p>
<p>It was great fun to see the group's work develop over the week and see them reflect on feedback.<br />Their end product was very impressive!</p>
<p>And as I’ve written this blog a few months after I had finished this, I’ve done a few more mentoring activities, which I’ve written about in these blogs below:</p>
